    <h2>Some Free Software that I Find Useful</h2>

    <p>Just a quick note that these are all on Windows, Mac, and Linux</p>
    
    <h4><a href="https://www.gimp.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GIMP</a></h4>
    <p>
        GIMP stands for GNU Image Manipulation Program. I don't do much image editing
        but GIMP has been all I need for when I do. If you are using photoshop and
        image editing is all you I have heard GIMP mentioned as a viable, free alternative.

    <h4><a href="https://joplinapp.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joplin</a></h4>
    <p>
        Joplin is a note taking software that uses markdown or plain text to create
        notes. It has a very friendly user interface so there is no need to worry about
        not knowing markdown. Joplin also has the ability to sync across devices.

    <h4><a href="https://obsproject.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OBS Studio</a></h4>
    <p>
        OBS stands for Open Broadcasting Software. As you may have gathered, this is
        an open source software for recording and streaming video. Most people already
        know about this one, but that is because it is such a good software.

    <h4><a href="https://www.openshot.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenShot</a></h4>
    <p>
        I'll be honest, I just searched free video editing a few days ago and found OpenShot.
        I just recently started need to edit video. However, an endorsement of the product is
        that a completely new person like me was able to pick it up without a tutorial and just
        some clicking around.

    <h4><a href="https://vcvrack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VCV Rack</a></h4>
    <p>
        This one is a little niche, but VCV is a music software that emulates a Eurorack
        modular synthesizer. It's pretty cool and I use to make music for my stream. If you
        are take a look and want to try it out (it's free so why not)
